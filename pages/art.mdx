# Art

I enjoy photography as well as creating art with code, you can find some of my work here:

import Image from "next/image";
import photography from "../public/images/photography.png";
import creativeCoding from "../public/images/creative-coding.png";

[<Image src={photography} alt="Photography"/>](https://works.shud.in)

<div style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>[Photography ↗](https://works.shud.in)</div>

And creative coding projects:
