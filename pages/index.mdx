# Shu Ding

I’m a designer and developer in Berlin, thinking and creating. Previously worked as a software engineer at Microsoft. Now building [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Started programming in high school and has since spent 4 years on algorithm competitions, worked as a freelance developer in Shanghai, and got a BSc degree in Computer Science from Fudan University. I have been contributing to open source since 2013, as well as making games, [creative coding](/art), and HCI experiments. Notable work:

- Creator of [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app), a data-fetching library for React, and leading the project since 2019. It now has millions of downloads per month on npm.
- Creator of [Next.js Live](https://vercel.com/live) at Vercel.
- Early designer and creator of the Next.js website in [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181227215910/https://nextjs.org).
- [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) for building better documentation with Next.js.
- [Mak](https://inns.studio/mak) for better writing experience.

And some of my experiments: [Y86](https://y86.js.org), [Metaballs](https://metaballs.vercel.app), [COBE](https://cobe.vercel.app), [CC](https://cc.shud.in), [VRS](https://v-r-s.vercel.app/edit/?id=1), [Flappy Cube](https://github.com/shuding/flappy-cube), [Inns](https://inns.studio), [赤徑](https://twitter.com/crimsonpathway).
